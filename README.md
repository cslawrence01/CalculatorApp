# Java Calculator Application

## Purpose of This Application

<p>This application implements the basic functionality of a calculator.
The main purpose of this application was to become more familiar with the Java programming languange</p>

## About this Application

<p>The basic template for this application was taken from a tutorial in Youtube from the
following source: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfhmTyRTCSQ&list=WL&index=18</p>

<p>In addition to the code provided by this tutorial, I made the following enhancements to the
application:</p>

1. Widened the size of the calculator so that the full text of some of the buttons would show
2. Updated the color theme of the calculator to a dark theme
3. Added validation to the events triggered when clicking on certain operators. Before this change, the program would
crash when, for example, a user would click of the "+" operator before clicking on an operand, like a number. Instead,
when this situation occurs, an invalidation format error message pops up.
